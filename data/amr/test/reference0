Let me go on by myself . "
" That will be so amusing !
" Ah , little prince , dear little prince !
It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth , and disappeared .
It was not such a heavy body ... and at night I love to listen to the stars .
You will have five hundred million little bells , and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water ... "
And , besides , I am going to make you a present ... "
And you will sometimes open your window , so , for that pleasure ... and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky !
I shall look as if I were dead ; and that will not be true ... "
Then you will say to them , ' Yes , the stars always make me laugh ! ' And they will think you are crazy .
The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night , and he watches over his sheep very carefully ... "
And then the little bells are changed to tears ...
" And when your sorrow is comforted ( time soothes all sorrows ) you will be content that you have known me .
And now six years have already gone by ...
And , if you should come upon this spot , please do not hurry on .
And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more .
And he laughed again .
" And at night you will look up at the stars .
And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens ... they will all be your friends .
And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing , when you look at the sky at night ... you - - only you - - will have stars that can laugh ! "
And he too said nothing more , because he was crying ...
And you will see how everything changes ...
And he sat down , because he was afraid .
And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars .
And he took me by the hand .
And no grown - up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance !
And she is so weak !
" All men have the stars , " he answered , " but they are not the same things for different people .
Ask yourselves : is it yes or no ?
All the stars are a - bloom with flowers ... "
Because of the pulley , and the rope , what you gave me to drink was like music .
Chapter 27 .
" It was wrong of you to come .
Do not come to see that .
Now my sorrow is comforted a little .
If this should happen , please comfort me .
The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive .
I was sad , but I told them : " I am tired . "
It is the same as that on the preceding page , but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory .
But he did not answer my plea .
But a thought came to reassure him : " It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite . "
But he made one more effort : " You know , it will be very nice .
But I know that he did go back to his planet , because I did not find his body at daybreak .
But he laughed lightly .
" But it will be like an old abandoned shell .
But he said to me : " Tonight , it will be a year ... my star , then , can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth , a year ago ... "
But at another time I say to myself : " At some moment or other one is absent - minded , and that is enough !
But all these stars are silent .
But there is one extraordinary thing ... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince , I forgot to add the leather strap to it .
But he was still worrying .
But he was worried .
He did not cry out .
For you who also love the little prince , and for me , nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere , we do not know where , a sheep that we never saw has - - yes or no ? -- eaten a rose ...
He was a little discouraged .
Has the sheep eaten the flower ?
He was afraid , there was no doubt about that .
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable .
There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle .
He got away from me without making a sound .
For some , who are travelers , the stars are guides .
Then I am happy .
She has four thorns , of no use at all , to protect herself against all the world ... "
You - - you alone - - will have the stars as no one else has them - - "
Where I live everything is so small that I can not show you where my star is to be found .
" I shall be much more afraid this evening ... "
It is better , like that .
It is too heavy . "
You will always be my friend .
He fell as gently as a tree falls .
" Here it is .
So now I keep wondering : what is happening on his planet ?
" Yes , I know ... "
Then , if a little man appears who laughs , who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions , you will know who he is .
He laughed again .
In one of them I shall be laughing .
" I shall not leave you , "
" In one of the stars I shall be living .
I , too , shall look at the stars .
If you love a flower that lives on a star , it is sweet to look at the sky at night .
Look up at the sky .
Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert .
I shall look a little as if I were dying .
" I shall look as if I were suffering .
I love to hear that laughter ! "
" Little man , "
He still hesitated a little ; then he got up .
Here , then , is a great mystery .
" Dear little man , "
She is so na√Øve !
For my businessman they were wealth .
This is , to me , the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world .
For others , who are scholars , they are problems .
On some one evening he forgot the glass globe , or the sheep got out , without making any noise , in the night ... "
He must not bite you .
For others they are no more than little lights in the sky .
This one might bite you just for fun ... "
I could not move .
I could see that he was reviving little by little .
I can not carry this body with me .
He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep .
All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink ... "
" That is my present .
Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower ...
He remained motionless for an instant .
You remember - - how good it was . "
" It will be as if , in place of the stars , I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh ... "
It is like five hundred million little bells ...
" It is just as it is with the flower .
For me , it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert .
It is like that .
It will be as it was when we drank the water ... "
" It is just as it is with the water .
I am responsible for her .
There is nothing sad about old shells ... "
He said to me merely : " Ah !
Then he said , again : " You know - - my flower ...
I said .
I said to him , " you are afraid ... "
At one time I say to myself : " Surely not !
I said nothing .
I said , " tell me that it is only a bad dream - - this affair of the snake , and the meeting - place , and the star ... "
Then he quickly became serious : " Tonight - - you know ... do not come , " said the little prince .
I said , " I want to hear you laugh again . "
That is to say - - not entirely .
That night I did not see him set out on his way .
Send me word that he has come back .
I too sat down , because I was not able to stand up any longer .
Snakes - - they are malicious creatures .
There was not even any sound , because of the sand .
All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley .
My star will just be one of the stars , for you .
He took one step .
When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step .
You will suffer .
He said to me , instead : " The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen ... "
" I tell you - - it is also because of the snake .
I have never yet told this story .
" There now - - that is all ... "
Just that .
" What are you trying to say ? "
It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you ... "
" You understand ... it is too far .
I waited a long time .
Wait for a time , exactly under the star .
